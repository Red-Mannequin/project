# Resonance

Resonance is an Android application being written as a class project for COMP3004 at Carleton University in the fall semester of 2016. 

### What is Resonance?

An application built to provide an expansive set of tools to create audio projects, which include songs with multiple tracks to simple voice memos. Resonance is taking functionality available on computer audio recording/processing programs and making it mobile. 

Resonance provides users with a powerful tool to harness creativity with a natural flowing and quick to learn experience. 

### Team

We are Red Mannequin. 

Our team members include: 
- Matthew Fors
- Flavio Barinas
- Matt Walker
- Tom Robin

### Specifications

Resonance is supported on Lollipop 5.1 (22.2), and above. 

If installing a developer version of app, or compiling/installing on your accord you will need to go to Settings->Apps->Resonance->Permissions and enable the requested actions. These include permission to write/read to external storage and to access the microphone of your device. 

### Demo Summary

The prototype for Resonance features working recordings, project save/loads, project/track management, and a reverb effect demonstration. None of the features displayed in the demo are simulated. 

The prototype is a portrayl of the direction that Resonance is taking, but it still lacks key features that will greatly increase the usability of the application. 

### Current Progress

We currently have a working prototype which allows a user to create projects, add tracks, and record into the tracks. Users also have the ability to save the state of a project and save it for later use.

### Difficulties 

It took us a while to get a good grasp on the best way to communicate as a team and ensure that everybody is on the same page. We fixed this by coming up with a plan of action at one of our weekly meetings to ensure that we had better communication between members developing various parts of the application. 

We have also found that developing on Android has been a learning curve. This is because of some rules that Android defines for their applications (device usage, storage access), which forced us to develop certain forms of methods to work within Android's boundaries. These are issues that have been overcome by ensuring that every aspect of development is thought out before getting to work, and that the method to be used is researched thouroughly. 

### Work in Progress

We are currently working on features such as:

#### Added Effects
  - Bass Boost
  - Reverb
  - Pitch Shift
  - and more.
  
#### Standalone Tracks
  - For when you don't want to make an entire project to create a single track.
  
#### UI Flow/Control
  - We want Resonance to be intuitive, smoothe, and appealing.
